# Kana-Totsugeki

A simple game for learning the Japanese kana!

Currently supports the basic hiragana, katakana, and romaji.

You can choose to pull questions from any of these categories or even change what the game should accept as an answer (for example you can answer each question in only hiragana).

There is a slow mode (7.5 seconds to answer), medium mode (5 seconds to answer), and a fast mode (2.5 seconds to answer).

You can choose between 1 life, 3 lives, or 5 lives.

Each kana you get right will give you 100 points and each you get wrong will take away 100 points (no lower than 0).

At the end of the game (when you run out of lives) you will be shown your final score and the number of kana that you got correct!
